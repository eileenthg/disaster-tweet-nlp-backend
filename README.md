# disaster-tweet-nlp-backend
First attempt at coding a machine learning model for Natural Language Processing. This uses java and weka.
Created for final project of Basic AI during degree studies. This backend is meant to be connected to a web interface.

Note: You may have to install and link weka 3.8.5 manually for the entire thing to run.
This thing unfortunately has no documentation. If I were to revisit this I'd refactor it from the ground up.
